HTML 5 comes with a standard way of embedding audio files as previously we don’t have any such support on a web page. Supported audio formats are as follows:

MP3
Wav
Ogg.
Below is the most simple way to embed an audio file on a web page.

<audio controls>
    <source src=”jamshed.mp3″ type=”audio/mpeg”>
    Your browser does’nt support audio embedding feature.
</audio>
