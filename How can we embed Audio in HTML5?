HTML 5 comes with a standard way of embedding audio files as previously we don’t have any such support on a web page. Supported audio formats are as follows:

MP3
Wav
Ogg.
Below is the most simple way to embed an audio file on a web page.

<audio controls>
    <source src=”jamshed.mp3″ type=”audio/mpeg”>
    Your browser does’nt support audio embedding feature.
</audio>
In above code, src value can be relative as well as absolute URL. We can also use multiple <source> elements pointing to different audio files. There are more new attributes for <audio> tag other than src as below:

controls – it adds controls such as volume, play and pause.
autoplay – it’s a boolean value which specifies that audio will start playing once it’s ready.
loop – it’s also a boolean value which specifies looping (means it automatically start playing after it ends).
preload – auto, metadata and none are the possible values for this attribute.
auto means plays as it loaded.
metadata displays audio file’s associated data
none means not pre-loaded.
