HTML 5 has the capability to store data locally. Previously it was done with the help of cookies.
Exciting thing about this storage is that its fast as well as secure.

There are two different objects which can be used to store data.

localStorage object stores data for a longer period of time even if the browser is closed.
sessionStorage object stores data for a specific session.
sessionStorage
localStorage
It persists data until we close the window or tab in which it was stored.	It persist data even if the window or tab is closed (but can be explicitly removed or expires).
Values stored in sessionStorage are not shared. These will be visible only to respective window or tab.	Values stored in localStorage are shared for all windows and tabs from same origin.
Maximum size is 5MB.	Maximum size for localStorage is more between 10-15MB.
