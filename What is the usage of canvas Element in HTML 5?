<canvas> is an element in HTML5 which we can use to draw graphics with the help of scripting (which is most probably JavaScript).
This element behaves like a container for graphics and rest of things will be done by scripting. We can draw images, graphs and a bit of animations etc using <canvas> element.

<canvas id=”canvas1″ width=”300″ height=”100″>
</canvas>
